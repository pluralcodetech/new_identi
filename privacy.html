                            We know it’s tempting to skip these Terms of use, but it’s 
                            important to establish what you can expect from us as you use 
                            identi, and what we expect from you. This Terms reflect the way 
                            our platform works, and define our relationship with you as you 
                            interact with our services. For example, these terms include the 
                            following topic headings:
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <a href="#">What you can expect from us</a>, 
                            which describes how we provide and develop our services
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <a href="#">What we expect from you</a>, which establishes certain rules for using our services
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <a href="#">Content on Identi directory</a> , which describes the intellectual property rights to the content you find in our services — whether that content belongs to you, Identi, or others
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Understanding these terms is important because, by using our services, you’re agreeing to these terms.
                            Besides these terms, we also publish a Privacy Policy. Although it’s not part of these terms, we encourage you to read it to better understand how you can delete your information.
                        </p>

                        <h3>What you can expect from us</h3>
                        <p>
                            Our platform is merely a directory that lists individuals or 
                            organisations that are notorious for being unavailable or 
                            unreachable to complete a deal they once opted in for. 
                            In a bid to protect the community from such ones, 
                            we will keep maintaining a database of such ones, 
                            available for query using their email, phone number, 
                            name or Bank Verification Number (BVN). 
                            As we seek partnerships with third-party 
                            organizations, we will try to ensure that 
                            this directory impacts on the lives of those 
                            listed there, so much so that they are willing 
                            to make amends in their forfeited business deals.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In addition to our website and mobile app, we will provide 
                            Application Programming Interface (API) to organizations that 
                            wish to integrate our search product. These terms of use and the 
                            applicable agreements we have with such organizations will govern 
                            the use of our APIs.
                        </p>

                        <h3>What we expect from you</h3>

                        <p>
                            The permission we give you to use our services continues as 
                            long as you comply with our terms of use.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We want to maintain a respectful environment for everyone, 
                            which means you must follow these basic rules of conduct:
                        </p>

                        <p class="conditions">comply with applicable laws</p>
                        <p class="conditions mb-2">respect the rights of others, including privacy by giving your defaulters a sufficient response window before enlisting them on the directory</p>
                        <p class="conditions mt-2">don’t abuse or harm others or yourself (or threaten or encourage such abuse or harm) — for example, by misleading, defrauding, illegally impersonating, defaming, bullying, harassing, or stalking others</p>
                        <p class="conditions mt-2">don’t abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt the services — for example, by accessing or using them in fraudulent or deceptive ways, introducing malware, or spamming, hacking, or bypassing our systems or protective measures. </p>

                        <h3>Content on Identi directory</h3>

                        <p>
                            The content listings on Identi directory are the exclusive properties of the organization that uploaded them. 
                            In the spirit of mutual concern, these organizations agree to share 
                            such contents with the general public and fellow organizations in other to protect them from a similar default. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the general public, we will display certain sensitive, private data 
                            including phone number, email, and BVN as masked. Verified and registered 
                            organizations will however, have a full view of these data to enable them 
                            make stringent business decisions
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Although, it is the responsibility of each organization to delete its listings 
                            whenever necessary, Identi may delete listings with questionable eligibility.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Handling problems or disagreements</h3>

                        <p>
                            Both these terms and the law give you the right to 
                            (1) a certain quality of service, and (2) ways to fix problems if things go wrong.
                        </p>

                        <p><b>For all Users</b></p>

                        <p>
                            A sufficient response window is given prior to being enlisted on Identi. 
                            When you get a notice that you will be listed on Identi, and you want 
                            to contest that action, we have provided you with appropriate prompts 
                            to handle that situation. Once you reconnect with the organization 
                            that enlisted you, we hope that you should be able to resolve the 
                            issue at this initiation level.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If the response window has passed and you have been listed, you can still 
                            initiate a dispute using the Dispute button displayed close to your name on 
                            the directory. This will reconnect you with the organization(s) that enlisted 
                            you, we hope that you should be able to resolve the issue at this advanced level.
                        </p>

                        <p><b>Warranty</b></p>

                        <p>
                            We provide our services on the premise that both the interests of users and organizations are protected. 
                            If the Dispute arrangement doesn’t seem to work for you, 
                            you agree to <a href="#">contact</a> us and we’ll work with you to try to resolve the issue with the organization in question.
                        </p>

                        <p><b>Disclaimer</b></p>

                        <p>
                            The only commitments we make about our services 
                            (including the content in the services, the specific 
                            functions of our services, or their reliability, 
                            availability, or ability to meet your needs) are 
                            provided in (1) the <a href="#">Warranty</a> section; (2) the service-specific 
                            additional terms stated in our agreement with organizations; and 
                            (3) laws that can’t be limited by these terms.
                        </p>

                        <p><b>Liabilities</b></p>

                        <p>
                            To the extent allowed by applicable law, you’ll indemnify 
                            Identi and its directors, officers, employees, and contractors 
                            for any third-party legal proceedings 
                            (including actions by government authorities) arising out of 
                            or relating to your unlawful use of the services or violation of 
                            these terms or service-specific additional terms. 
                            This indemnity covers any liability or expense arising 
                            from claims, losses, damages, judgments, fines, litigation 
                            costs, and legal fees.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If you’re legally exempt from certain responsibilities, including indemnification, 
                            then those responsibilities don’t apply to you under these terms.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Identi won’t be responsible for the following liabilities:

                            This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what 
                            information we collect, why we collect it and how you

                        <h3>Information Identtii Collects</h3>
                        <p>
                            Our search product rides on several, multiple and diversified data sources. 
                            identtii does not usually collect user information directly.
                        </p>


                        <h3>Information Organizations Provide</h3>

                        <p>
                            User information including name, email, phone number, Bank Verification Number (BVN), 
                            and picture are provided by third-party organizations who’s Privacy Policies, 
                            we believe, allow for such. 
                        </p>
                        

                        <h3>Information Users Provide</h3>

                        <p>
                            Sometimes users may want to dispute a search result and as such reconnect with the 
                            organization that enlisted them on our directories. When this happens, 
                            the user provides additional personal information including his primary 
                            and secondary phone numbers. This information is shared directly with the 
                            organization(s) that blacklisted the user. 
                        </p>
                        

                        <h3>Why identtii Collects Information</h3>

                        <p>
                            As a public directory, we collect information to enable the community 
                            become aware of individuals or organizations that are reputable or 
                            notorious for being unavailable or unreachable after entering into deals.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This information, we believe, will help them to decide whether 
                            to enter new deals with the user and also help the user to get whitelisted.
